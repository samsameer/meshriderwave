## Executive Summary

The global Push-to-Talk (PTT) market is projected to reach **$57.4 billion by 2028** (MarketsandMarkets, 2023), growing at a 10.2% CAGR. MeshRider Wave is uniquely positioned to capture significant market share by bridging the gap between tactical mesh networks and traditional cellular PTT systems.

**Key Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Dual-Track GTM**: Pursue defense contracts (high value, long cycle) and commercial verticals (faster revenue) simultaneously
2. **Hybrid Business Model**: Freemium for consumer/SMB, SaaS subscription for enterprise, perpetual licenses for defense
3. **Strategic Partnerships**: Samsung (device), AT&T (FirstNet), ATAK ecosystem integration
4. **Funding Strategy**: SBIR Phase I/II → Defense VC → Strategic exit
