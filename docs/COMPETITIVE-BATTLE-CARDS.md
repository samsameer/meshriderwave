**Objection**: "Motorola is the gold standard in public safety."

**Response**:
> "Motorola has an excellent reputation, and for good reason. However, the communications landscape is changing. MeshRider Wave delivers comparable MCPTT capabilities at half the cost, with the added benefit of operating off-grid through mesh networks. We're not asking you to rip out your Motorola system—we can extend it to areas where it currently can't reach."

**Objection**: "We have a multi-year contract with Motorola."

**Response**:
> "Contract transitions are always challenging. Many of our customers start with a pilot program for specific use cases where mesh capability provides clear value—remote sites, disaster response, or tactical operations. This proves the value without disrupting your existing operations, and positions you well for contract renewal discussions."

**Objection**: "We need LMR interoperability."

**Response**:
> "LMR interoperability is important, and we support it through our MCPTT gateway capability. When connected to the MCPTT network, MeshRider Wave can communicate with traditional LMR systems. Additionally, our mesh capability means you can extend coverage beyond traditional radio range without building new towers."

#### Winning Plays
1. **Cost Comparison**: 50% savings with comparable capability
2. **Off-Grid Demo**: Show mesh working where WAVE fails
3. **Speed to Deploy**: Deploy in days vs. months

Our MCPTT gateway allows seamless handoff between FirstNet and mesh networks. You get the best of both worlds: priority cellular where available, and mesh coverage where it's not."

**Objection**: "FirstNet has preemption during emergencies."

**Response**:
> "Preemption is critical for emergency response. When connected to FirstNet through our gateway, MeshRider Wave users benefit from the same preemption capabilities. Plus, if the network is completely down, our mesh capability ensures you still have communications—something FirstNet alone can't provide."

**Objection**: "FirstNet is the government standard."

**Response**:
> "FirstNet is an important part of the public safety ecosystem, but it's not the complete solution.
